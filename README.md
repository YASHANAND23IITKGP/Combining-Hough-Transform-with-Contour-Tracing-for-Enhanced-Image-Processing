# Combining-Hough-Transform-with-Contour-Tracing-for-Enhanced-Image-Processing
This is a Python implementation of the Fast Hough transform. It was done as a course Capstone project for Signal Processing System Design Laboratory (EE69205), under the guidance of Prof. Debdoot Sheet.

## Our Proposed Method
*This algorithm leverages an enhanced Hough transform, optimizing the classic approach by incorporating insights from a contour tracing technique known as the Moore-Neighbor algorithm. Departing from the conventional method of generating all potential lines for each edge map pixel, this approach selectively computes lines that genuinely pertain to the image. 
*The objective is to streamline the process and focus computational efforts on lines with significant relevance to the given image.
